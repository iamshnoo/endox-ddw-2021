      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Our work achieves
      state-of-the-art results using a deep convolutional neural network based
      approach for detecting cecal intubation and bowel preparation level, both
      of which are very important for reducing post-colonoscopy colorectal
      cancer chances in patients undergoing the procedure.</p>

      <h3>Automated detection of cecal intubation with variable bowel
        preparation</h3>

      <p>
        We use a deep convolutional neural network to detect colonoscopy
        completion with varying bowel preparation to better understand
        completion of the procedure and thus reduce the chances of
        post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer.

      <h3>Automated detection of bowel preparation with deep
      convolutional neural networks</h3>

      <p>
        Inadequate bowel preparation increases chances of post-colonoscopy
        colorectal cancer. We use a deep convolutional neural network to detect
        adequacy of bowel preparation using Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).
